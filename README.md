# AI Drifting with PPO

Welcome to the AI Drifting project! This repository contains scripts and resources for training an AI agent to learn how to drift using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and various other techniques.

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop an AI agent capable of drifting in a simulated environment. The agent is trained using reinforcement learning techniques, primarily PPO. The environment setup, challenges faced, and solutions are documented in a series of videos.
